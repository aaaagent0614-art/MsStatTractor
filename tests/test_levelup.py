"""EXP accounting across a level-up.

The game's EXP counter resets to ~0 at every level, so `end - start` -- which
is what Session.exp_diff did -- turns a real gain into a large negative the
moment a session spans a level-up. Observed live 2026-08-18: a genuine ~48k
gain rendered as "+-379,946" in the HUD (the '+' is hardcoded in _render).

A bare EXP *drop* is ambiguous: it is either a level-up or an OCR misread, and
misreads are known to happen (see rate.py's _LossTracker). The level is what
disambiguates -- EXP dropping while the level rises is a level-up; EXP
dropping with the level unchanged is noise and must not be counted.
